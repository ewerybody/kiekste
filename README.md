# but why!? ლ(´﹏`ლ)
I know. There are already more screenshot tools than grains of sand in the observable universe. And yes I know [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) and it was a big inspiration but .. OK here are my main points what I wanna have:

- [x] [#1](https://github.com/ewerybody/kiekste/issues/1) Draw rectangle, let it stay there, let me change it
- [x] [#2](https://github.com/ewerybody/kiekste/issues/2) Remember my last drawn rectangle
- [ ] [#3](https://github.com/ewerybody/kiekste/issues/3) Take videos just the SAME convenient way one takes screenshots
- [ ] [#4](https://github.com/ewerybody/kiekste/issues/4) Pick rectangle from existing windows
- [ ] [#5](https://github.com/ewerybody/kiekste/issues/5) Let me change the Cursor shape/position on/off
- [ ] [#6](https://github.com/ewerybody/kiekste/issues/6) Make it work with high DPI and multiple screens

Well in the combination I've seen nothing yet. So I've been hacking. Looking good so far. I'll keep doing it :)

On top of these there are SO much more awesome things one can do. Of course I'd like to:
- [ ] draw other things on the shot right away without opening something else.
- [ ] upload to favorite targets
- [ ] ...
